Click the BINDER button above to open the lab. This repository contains files and code to run an Earthquake Lab for an Introductory Geology class. The lab involves reading in and exploring earthquake data collected in New Mexico. Students will make figures showing spatial distribution of earthquakes and gain an understanding of the regional seismicity patterns.
